            <p>
                Every time there&rsquo;s a major outage at Meta, the first question I get from friends and family is usually
                <em>&ldquo;did they fire the person who caused it?&rdquo;</em> which is where I have to explain this concept
                of <strong>No Blame SEV Culture</strong>. Especially for an outage so big that a significant number of users
                are affected, the <em>individual</em> causing it likely does not have ill intent and there are likely multiple
                different processes and systems that failed along the way to get us here in the first place.

                    share my strong opinions on engineering practices.

            <h2>Process over People</h2>
            <p>
                When something goes wrong (especially something <em>really catastrophic</em>), it&rsquo;s usually a combination of
                both process and people problems. The difference here is that process is more deterministic compared to people.
                People have off-days, get tired, make mistakes etc. so it&rsquo;s important to have a process (or automated systems)
                in place to prevent that. This can mean anything from adding more test coverage, lint rules against bad code patterns,
                and / or more alerts. It is however important to note that they need to <strong>maintain a certain level of quality
                bar</strong>. As mentioned in <a href="https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-push-fearlessly-with-automated-testing/#broken-tests" target="_blank" rel=”noopener noreferrer”>the previous
                article</a>, flaky / broken tests are tech debt, same goes for noisy lint rules and alerts. Too many noisy lint rules and
                alerts would lead to engineers disregarding them or adopting a &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; mentality which is not ideal in
                preventing future outages.
