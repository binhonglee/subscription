                When I had the idea on the series about
                <a style="color: #1e681e;" href="https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-the-opinionated-engineer/" target="_blank" rel=”noopener noreferrer”>The Opinionated Engineer</a>, I
                figured maybe that&rsquo;s something worth setting up a newsletter service over. That said, after some
                consideration, I just thought that I didn&rsquo;t need anything too complex and decided to roll my own
                because &ldquo;how hard could it be?&rdquo;. As far as I can tell, I think it&rsquo;s working fine so
                far(?) and took me around one whole day to put the whole thing together from my couch. You can find all
                of it&rsquo;s source code <a style="color: #1e681e;" href="https://github.com/binhonglee/subscription" target="_blank" rel=”noopener noreferrer”>here on GitHub</a>.

            <h2>Existing newsletter services</h2>
            <p>
                Aside from Substack, pretty much all other services provide it with a "freemium" model where you are charged based on the number of subscribers (regardless if they are paid). Admittedly, I doubt my newsletter would get to that point (I try to not take myself too seriously lol) but I also didn't need most of the things those services are providing. Not to take anything away from them, they all seem really useful if someone is doing that for a living, but I mostly write for fun and as a way to do some knowledge preservation (future self-reference) with the sharing part mostly being a bonus.

                As for Substack, I didn't look too deep into things and while they don't have the best of reputation, their product seems to fit my use case best where I won't have to pay anything ever unless I started having paid subscribers. That said, I thought I didn't need something as fancy but just something simple that goes with my personal blog.
